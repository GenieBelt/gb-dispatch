# Library to dispatch block on queues.
# It is inspired by GCD but implementation is based on Celluloid.
# Current implementation ensure that block on queue will be executed in the same order
# as added, however it doesn't ensure on which thread it will run.
#
# == Threading
# Each queue have it is own thread, but their only for synchronisation.
# All execution happens on runners thread pool. Pool size is limited to number of cores
# of the machine.
